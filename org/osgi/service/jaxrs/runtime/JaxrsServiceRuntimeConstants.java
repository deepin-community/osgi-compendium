	 * An endpoint value is a URL or a relative path, to which the JAX-RS
	 * Whiteboard implementation is listening. For example,
	 * {@code http://192.168.1.10:8080/} or {@code /myapp/}. A relative path may

	 * if a bridged Http Whiteboard implementation is used. If the JAX-RS
	 * Whiteboard implementation is serving the root context and neither scheme
	 * nor authority is known, the value of the property is "/". Both, a URL and
	 * a relative path, must end with a slash.
	 * <p>
	 * A JAX-RS Whiteboard implementation can be listening on multiple
	 * endpoints.
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * The value of this service property must be of type {@code String},
	 * {@code String[]}, or {@code Collection<String>}.
